<div class='chaptertitle'>YOUNG SIEGFRIED</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In the</span> good old days of Long
Ago, when kings had absolute
power over all their subjects, even
in the matter of life and death,
there dwelt in the city of Santum,
on the beautiful Rhine River,
a great and good king named
Siegmund.</p>

<p>He was very powerful, and ruled
over the kingdom of Niederland
so wisely and so well that he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
loved and honored by all his
people. He shared his throne
with Siegelinda, his beautiful wife,
who also was noble and kind of
heart.</p>

<p>Siegmund and Siegelinda had
one son, called Siegfried&mdash;a handsome,
well-built lad, with eyes as
blue and sunny as the sky above
on a fair spring morning. He was
the only child of the king and
queen, but he was more of a sorrow
than a joy to them, for he was
as willful and disobedient as he was
beautiful. He could not bear to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
be crossed in any way, and wished
that he were a man, so that he
might do exactly as he pleased.</p>

<p>Siegfried's parents loved him
dearly in spite of his faults and all
the sorrow his wild ways caused
them. But one fine morning, while
the king and queen were still asleep,
he quietly took his hat, and stole out
of the castle, for he had made up
his mind to go out into the wide
world to seek his fortune.</p>

<p>Siegfried walked through the
beautiful city, and then for some
time followed a winding country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
road, until at length he found himself
in the midst of a dense forest.
But he was not afraid; he could
hear the birds singing and calling
to one another in the green trees
overhead, and now and then a
rabbit or a timid squirrel ran across
his pathway, and disappeared in
the bushes.</p>

<p>So he wandered along, quite
happy. Sometimes he would come
to a little brook, winding its
way through the trees and grass,
and babbling and singing among
its pebbles. Across the stream<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
he would leap, as lightly as a
hare.</p>

<p>Thus the day wore on, and as
twilight gathered, he began to feel
very tired and hungry. He was
just beginning to wonder what he
should do, when he noticed that he
was nearing the edge of the forest,
and a little farther on what should
he see but a blacksmith's shop
among the bushes.</p>

<p>In the doorway stood the smith
himself in his leathern apron&mdash;a
little, odd, misshapen dwarf named
Mimi. He looked in wonder at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the beautiful boy, who smiled upon
him in a friendly way, and said:</p>

<p>"Good-evening. I am almost
dead with thirst and hunger; will
you not take me in, and let me be
your helper?"</p>

<p>Mimi was about to say no, when
he chanced to look at Siegfried
the second time. He noticed how
strong and well built the boy was;
so he said:</p>

<p>"I am not really in need of a
helper, for in this out-of-the-way
place there is very little work to be
done; but if you wish to learn my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
trade, I am willing to give you a
trial."</p>

<p>Siegfried was happy to hear this,
and with a hearty relish he ate
the coarse brown bread and bowl
of milk which Mimi brought to
him.</p>

<p>The next morning the blacksmith
showed Siegfried how to
blow the bellows, and swing the
sledge-hammer, and also how to
shape a horseshoe.</p>

<p>"Now, you try it," he said, laying
a red-hot piece of iron on the
anvil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Siegfried was eager to try. He
raised the hammer above his head,
and brought it down with such
force that the iron flew to pieces
and the anvil was buried in the
ground.</p>

<p>Mimi was very angry. He gave
the boy a box on the ear that
nearly knocked him over. Now,
Siegfried was a king's son, and
never before in all his life had
any one but his parents dared to
punish him. Therefore he was
indignant, and without giving
Mimi a moment's warning, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
seized the dwarf by the collar and
dashed him to the ground.</p>

<p>When Mimi came to his senses,
he was almost dead with pain and
fright. He made up his mind
then and there that he would have
his revenge, but he knew he was
no match for Siegfried in strength;
so he picked himself up, and pretended
that he was not in the least
angry. After a while he sent
Siegfried to fetch a basket of coal
from the colliery, which was near
a great linden tree in the forest.
Under this tree dwelt a terrible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
monster, and Mimi hoped that the
huge beast would make an end of
the lad.</p>

<p>As Siegfried reached the tree,
out rushed the monster, with open
jaws, ready to devour him. But
the boy nimbly sprang aside, and
uprooting a tree which stood near,
he brought it down with such
force on the monster's back that
the huge creature was dazed by
the blow, and lay writhing in
pain.</p>

<p>Then quick as thought, Siegfried
pulled up tree after tree, and piled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
them high above the struggling
monster, pinning him fast to the
earth. Thus he slowly crushed
the terrible beast to death.</p>

<p>As he stood there watching, a
pool of blood oozed slowly out
from under the pile of trees. He
dipped his finger in it without
thinking, and was surprised and
delighted to find that his finger
had become as hard as horn, and
that he could neither scratch nor
pierce it.</p>

<p>"What a fine thing!" thought the
lad. "I will bathe myself in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
pool, and then nothing on earth
can harm me."</p>

<p>Accordingly, he quickly undressed
and bathed himself in the
pool; but as he was stooping over,
a broad leaf from the linden tree
fell upon his back, between the
shoulders, and the spot where
it lay was not touched by the
monster's blood. Siegfried knew
nothing of the leaf. "Now," said
he to himself, "I am safe; neither
sword nor spear can wound me."
Then he cut off the monster's
head, filled Mimi's basket with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
coal, and carried both back to
the smithy.</p>

<p>Mimi could hardly believe his
eyes when Siegfried appeared; he
began to fear the wonderful
strength of this half-grown boy,
and to hate him with a deadly
hatred. However, he was far too
wise to let Siegfried know his feelings,
and so he praised the lad's
courage highly. But he at once
began to think of another plan to
get rid of him.</p>

<p>That night, while they were sitting
together before the fire, Mimi said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know of an adventure which
would just suit you, Siegfried. If
you succeed in it, it will make you
famous all over the world, and you
will be very rich."</p>

<p>The boy was eager to be off at
once, but the dwarf declared that
Siegfried must first listen to a long,
strange story. Mimi bade him
give good heed to what he was
about to hear.</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MIMI'S STORY</div>


<p><span class="smcap">My father</span> was a dwarf, and
belonged to a race of dwarfs called
the Nibelungs. He had three
sons, Fafner, Otto, and myself.
Fafner was the eldest; I was
the youngest. Otto, my second
brother, was very fond of fishing,
and liked nothing better than to
spend whole days at the sport.</p>

<p>My father had a magic cap
called a tarnhelm. Any one who
put this cap on could make himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
invisible, or assume any form
he desired. Otto would borrow
this tarnhelm, and assuming the
form of an otter, he would go to a
waterfall near our home to fish.
He would go right into the water,
and catching the fish in his mouth,
would lay them down on the bank,
one after another, until he had
enough. Then he would become
himself once more and would carry
the fish home for supper.</p>

<p>Near this waterfall there lived
another dwarf, named Alberich,
who also belonged to the race of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the Nibelungs. He possessed a
great treasure of gold, which he
had captured from the nymphs of
the Rhine. The father of the
nymphs, the God of the Rhine,
had entrusted the treasure to
their care.</p>

<p>Alberich gained possession of
the Rhine gold, but in doing so
he lost everything which helps to
make life beautiful. Like my
brother, he was very fond of fishing,
and taking the form of a huge
pike, he would go with Otto to the
waterfall, and fish all day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>One day Wotan, the King of the
Gods, was wandering through the
forest with Loki, the God of Fire.
They were both very tired and
hungry, and as they came near the
waterfall, what should they spy but
an otter in the water, with a large
salmon in its mouth. Here was a
chance not to be missed.</p>

<p>Seizing a big stone, Loki hurled
it with all his might at the otter,
killing it instantly. Then they
carried it to my father's house, and
begged for a night's lodging.</p>

<p>As soon as my father saw the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
otter, he told them that they had
killed his son. Both Wotan and
Loki were very sorry to hear this,
and regretted that they could not
restore my brother to life. To
make up to my father for what
they had done, they agreed to fill
the otter skin with gold, and also
to cover the outside of it with the
same precious metal. Then Wotan
sent Loki out in search of
gold.</p>

<p>Now Loki knew that the dwarf
Alberich possessed the Rhine gold;
so he hastened to the waterfall,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and demanded the entire treasure.</p>

<p>At first Alberich refused to part
with the gold; but Loki threatened
to kill him unless he gave it
up. So Alberich unwillingly gave
the treasure to Loki&mdash;all except a
ring of gold, which he kept hidden
in his hand. But the god's eyes
were sharp, and he saw what Alberich
had done.</p>

<p>Now this ring was a magic ring,
and whoever owned it might claim
all the gold in all the rivers and
mountains upon earth. Alberich<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
believed that if he kept it he could
some day get back his treasure
through its magic power.</p>

<p>Loki commanded him to give it
up, and the dwarf refused to do so.
Seeing that words were useless,
the god snatched it from Alberich's
hand, and started off. Alberich
fell into a terrible fury, and cried:</p>

<p>"A curse upon the gold! Death
to all its possessors!"</p>

<p>But Loki had obtained that
which he set out to get. The
gold was not to be his, and he
cared nothing for the dwarf and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
his curses. He only laughed at
Alberich, and hastened with his
burden to my father's house.</p>

<p>When Wotan saw the gold ring,
he was so pleased with its beauty
that he placed it on his finger, intending
to keep it for himself.
Then they filled the otter's skin
with gold, and also covered it
over, according to their promise.
When they had finished, my father
discovered one spot on its head
upon which there was no gold.
He insisted upon having this covered
up, and since there was no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
more gold to be had, Wotan unwillingly
took the ring from his
finger, and placed it there.</p>

<p>Loki was displeased, and cried:</p>

<p>"Now, you ingrate, you have the
most enormous gold treasure in
the world, and I hope you are
satisfied! But remember what I
say: The gold will prove your
ruin, and it will also cause your
son to fill an early grave."</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 318px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;FLEE FOR YOUR LIFE ERE I SMITE YOU DEAD&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Then the gods took their departure.</p>

<p>Fafner and I asked our father to
give us each a share of the gold;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
but he only laughed in a disagreeable
way, and declared his dead
son was far more precious to him
than were his living sons. He
said that every hair on Otto's
head was dear to him. Then
he ran after us with a stone club,
and swore that he would kill us
if we said another word. We said
no more, and crept away in fear.</p>


<p>But that night as my father lay
asleep, Fafner stole into his room
and slew him. Then I came forward,
and told my brother that I
had witnessed his evil deed, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
demanded that he give me half of
the gold. But he turned upon me
in a blind rage, and cried:</p>

<p>"Flee for your life ere I smite
you dead!"</p>

<p>I fled in fear, without another
word. Then Fafner put on my
father's tarnhelm and escaped with
his treasure to the heath, where he
hid it in a cave among the rocks.
But, fearful lest it be taken from
him, he assumed the form of a
frightful dragon, that he might
protect it better.</p>

<p>And there he lies day and night,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
guarding the entrance of the cave,
and leaves it only when he goes
to drink at a neighboring spring.
No one has dared attack him, for
no one has the strength to match
him.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SIEGFRIED'S SWORD</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Mimi had finished his
story, he looked at Siegfried, who
had been drinking in every word
with breathless interest, and asked:</p>

<p>"Well, my lad, what do you think
of that? Do you think you could
kill the dragon?"</p>

<p>Siegfried answered, with shining
eyes:</p>

<p>"Come, Mimi, forge me a mighty
sword, and lead the way to Fafner's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
cave, and I will show you
what I can do."</p>

<p>So Mimi set to work to fashion a
sword for Siegfried. It was to be
the strongest, sharpest one that
man had ever made. The dwarf
worked day and night until it was
finished.</p>

<p>When he gave it to Siegfried,
the boy examined it carefully,
shook his head as though in doubt,
and then strode to the anvil. He
struck the iron one powerful blow
with the sword, and the weapon
lay in pieces.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Mimi told him not to worry, and
at once set to work upon some of
his most finely tempered steel, resolved
to make a sword that would
be a match for Siegfried's unheard-of
strength.</p>

<p>But when it was finished, Siegfried
took it as he had taken the
first, and in a moment the blade
was shattered on the anvil. Then
he grew angry and rushed at the
dwarf, crying:</p>

<p>"Oh! you worthless fellow, get
you hence or I will kill you!"</p>

<p>Mimi was badly frightened, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
hid himself behind the fireplace
not knowing what might happen
next. But after a while Siegfried's
anger began to cool; then
Mimi emerged from his hiding-place,
and Siegfried saw that he
held something in each hand.
When the dwarf came close
enough, the lad saw that he carried
two halves of a splendid
sword.</p>

<p>This Mimi declared was none
other than the sword Wotan had
carried on the day upon which
Otto was killed. "And," he continued,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
"if I can but weld it together,
you will have the finest
sword that ever a hero wielded."
Siegfried could scarcely wait until
Mimi finished the work, so anxious
was he to try the weapon.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 312px;">
<img src="images/illus039.png" width="312" height="500" alt="THE MIGHTY SWORD WAS UNHURT" title="" />
<span class="caption">THE MIGHTY SWORD WAS UNHURT</span>
</div>

<p>At length it was ready, and he
seized it, crying: "Now for the
test! Now for the test!" Then
he raised the mighty blade high
above his head, and brought it
down with all his strength upon
the anvil. The whole house shook
and trembled, and the anvil was
split in two, but the weapon&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
mighty sword that Wotan himself
had flourished&mdash;was unhurt.</p>

<p>And now Mimi was thoroughly
frightened, for he thought that
Siegfried must be Thor himself.
But he hid his fear, and cried:</p>

<p>"Avenge me, Siegfried! Slay
this dragon, and one-half of the
Rhine gold shall be yours."</p>

<p>"Lead the way," the lad replied,
"and I will make short work of
him."</p>

<p>So Mimi started for the heath,
and Siegfried followed him joyfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>When they drew near the place,
Mimi pointed out a wide, blackened
trail leading through the
grass. This, he said, had been
made by Fafner, for it was the
path the dragon took each day
when he went to the spring to
drink. The dwarf told the boy
that Fafner spouted flames to
the right and left as he went
along, and threshed the grass with
his monstrous tail at every step.</p>

<p>Then he advised Siegfried to
dig a deep pit, hide himself in it,
and as the dragon crawled over it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
to pierce him to the heart from
underneath. Siegfried thought
the plan a good one, and proceeded
at once to dig.</p>

<p>He did not hear Mimi chuckling
to himself, behind his back. For
Mimi was bent upon destroying
him, and knew that as soon as he
had killed the monster, its blood
would fill the pit, and drown him.
Therefore the dwarf rejoiced. He
withdrew to a safe distance, and
hid himself, to await the coming
of the dragon, which he greatly
feared.</p>



<div class="figcenter" style="width: 577px;">
<img src="images/divider.png" width="577" height="179" alt="Divider" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<h2>IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE DEATH OF THE DRAGON</div>


<p><span class="smcap">As Siegfried</span> was digging, he
became aware of a tall one-eyed
stranger, clad in a long gray cloak,
who was standing near by, watching
him intently. The stranger
inquired what Siegfried was doing,
and upon being told, earnestly advised
the youth to dig several
pits, each opening out of the other,
so that he might escape the flow
of blood which would otherwise
drown him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Siegfried was very grateful for
the advice, and began to act upon
it at once. Then Wotan (for the
one-eyed stranger was none other
than the god) disappeared from
view. When he was through digging,
Siegfried heaped brush and
weeds above the first pit, so that it
might not be noticed, and getting
down into it, awaited the coming
of the dragon.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait. Of a
sudden, a great noise, like the
tramping of a thousand horses,
fell upon his ear. Then came a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
roaring as of the sea, and he saw
the huge monster come slowly
along, thrashing the earth with its
great tail, and spouting flames to
the left and the right.</p>

<p>On and on it came, until he
could feel its breath hot above his
face. He firmly grasped his
sword, and gave one swift upward
thrust, quickly withdrawing it, and
then he nimbly leaped into the
next pit, followed by a rush of
blood, and then through the next,
and so on, till he reached safe
ground.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>When he went back to the first
pit, he found the dragon writhing
and groaning in its death agony.
As soon as it saw him, it cried out,
for it still retained the power of
human speech:</p>

<p>"Oh! you unlucky one, the gold
will prove your ruin as it has mine.
A curse is on it. Who has it is
accursed!"</p>

<p>Saying this, the creature died.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 317px;">
<img src="images/illus047.png" width="317" height="500" alt="&quot;THE GOLD WILL PROVE YOUR RUIN!&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;THE GOLD WILL PROVE YOUR RUIN!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Then Siegfried carefully cleaned
his sword, and replaced it in its
sheath, and as he did so, he noticed
some blood upon his hand. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
licked it off, and no sooner had it
touched his tongue, than a strange
thing happened. He could understand
everything which the birds
overhead were saying. He stood
still and listened, and what was his
astonishment to find that they
were actually talking to him!</p>

<p>One told him that Mimi was untrue
to him, and was constantly
plotting his death; that even at
that very moment the dwarf was
approaching with a poisoned drink
which he would offer to Siegfried,
so that he might not have to keep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
his promise of sharing the Rhine
gold. The bird advised him to
kill the dwarf.</p>

<p>Sure enough, at that very moment
Mimi came forward, praising
Siegfried's bravery, and offering
him the poisoned drink in the most
friendly manner, smiling deceitfully
all the while. Our hero
turned upon him in anger, and
forced him to drain the cup himself,
whereupon the wretched
dwarf fell to earth, lifeless.</p>

<p>Then the birds told Siegfried to
enter the dragon's cave, and get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the ring and the tarnhelm, the
possession of which would make
him all-powerful. This he did,
and then he rolled the dragon's
enormous body to the entrance of
the cave, where the Rhine gold
still lay, and sealed up the entrance
with it.</p>

<p>As he stood there, wondering
what he should do next, he heard
the birds singing of a mountain
far away, where a maiden named
Brunhilda lay in an enchanted
sleep, surrounded by a ring of
magic flames. Here she must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
slumber till there should appear a
man strong and brave enough to
dash through the flames and
waken her with a kiss.</p>

<p>Siegfried determined to journey
to the mountain. So he returned
to the smithy, and saddled Mimi's
horse, which was a strong, faithful
creature, and then he rode away
to seek the sleeping maiden.</p>

<p>Many days and nights he wandered,
and at length, early one
morning as he ascended the highlands,
he saw a rosy glow in the
distance, which grew ever brighter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and brighter. "The rising sun," he
said to himself, but he knew that
it was not the rising sun. On and
on he rode, and ever brighter and
brighter grew the sky, until at
length he came upon the flames
themselves, and he knew that he
had reached his journey's end.</p>

<h2>V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE STORY OF BRUNHILDA</div>


<p><span class="smcap">As Siegfried</span> drew nearer, he
could hear the crackling of the
flames, and when his horse saw
the fire, the animal reared up on
its hind legs, and snorted in terror.
But Siegfried knew no fear. Putting
spurs to his horse, he boldly
forced it through the flames, and,
lo! both horse and rider passed
through unharmed.</p>

<p>Before Siegfried's eyes was a
wondrous sight. On the mountain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
stood a castle, the strangest ever
seen, for it was built entirely of
green marble, as were all the
buildings round it; and there, on the
grassy slope before the castle, lay
a young warrior, clad in shining
armor, with a helmet on his head.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 316px;">
<img src="images/illus055.png" width="316" height="500" alt="PUTTING SPURS TO HIS HORSE, HE BOLDLY FORCED IT THROUGH THE FLAMES" title="" />
<span class="caption">PUTTING SPURS TO HIS HORSE, HE BOLDLY FORCED IT THROUGH THE FLAMES</span>
</div>

<p>Siegfried went up to him, to
ask him where he might find
the maiden. But the warrior
was sunk in slumber, and made
no reply when Siegfried spoke.
Siegfried shook him roughly, to
waken him, but he still slept
on. Then Siegfried opened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the young man's visor and removed
his helmet. What was his
surprise to find, within, the long
fair hair and rosy face of a beautiful
woman!</p>

<p>This, then, was Brunhilda; it
could be no other. Bending over
her, he pressed a kiss lightly on
her lips. Immediately Brunhilda
awoke, and thanked the young
hero for breaking the magic spell
which bound her. Then, as they
sat together in the marble palace,
Brunhilda told her story.</p>

<p>She was one of Wotan's eight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
daughters who were called Walkyries.
They were beautiful goddesses
of immense size and
strength, and used to follow Wotan
when he went into battle.
Occasionally, when two knights or
two countries battled against each
other, they would award the palm
of victory to one or the other. It
was also their duty to carry all
slain heroes to Walhalla, the beautiful
palace of Wotan.</p>

<p>One day Brunhilda disobeyed
her father's orders, and awarded
the victory to the hero whom Wotan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
wished overthrown. Wotan
was very angry, and as a punishment
he forbade her to dwell
among the gods and goddesses,
and declared that never again
should she set foot in Walhalla.
Furthermore, he would cause her
to wed a mortal man, thus becoming
a mortal woman, instead of a
goddess.</p>

<p>Brunhilda was overcome with
grief, as were all of her sisters.
They all pleaded with Wotan not
to punish her in this way. But he
had already pronounced sentence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
upon her, and could not retract
his word. Then Brunhilda wept
piteously, and begged him at least
to grant that her husband might
be a hero. This he promised, and
then disclosed his plan.</p>

<p>He would sink her in a magic
sleep, and would order Loki, the
fire-god, to kindle some magic
flames, which were to encircle her.
She was to slumber until awakened
by a man brave enough to go
through fire for her sake. "And,"
continued Wotan, "of course only
a hero would show such courage."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Then he assured her that when
the hero came he should be unharmed
by the ring of fire.</p>

<p>And so, with streaming eyes,
Brunhilda bade her sisters a long
farewell. Never again, so long as
she lived, would she behold them.
Wotan was deeply touched when
he saw her grief, and with a last
tender kiss upon her beautiful
brow, he laid her on the grassy
slope, and pronounced the magic
words which bound her.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>GUNTHER AND KRIEMHILD</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Siegfried</span> remained for a long
time with Brunhilda at Isenheim
(which was the ancient name for
Ireland), where all the buildings
were of green marble. He then
started for home, promising her
that he would return and marry
her, as soon as he had visited his
parents, whom he now felt he had
treated very cruelly.</p>

<p>Brunhilda replied that she too
thought that he ought to visit his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
mother and father, but that he
must promise to return as soon as
he had done so. He readily promised,
and sealed his pledge by placing
his magic ring upon her finger.
Then he set out for Niederland.</p>

<p>On the way thither, he had to
pass through the city of Worms in
Burgundy. Now in this city dwelt
a powerful king called Gunther,
who ruled over all Burgundy. He
had an uncle named Hagen, who
was his dead father's brother, and
who was also Gunther's most
valued adviser on all occasions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Gunther was so great and mighty
that four and twenty kings paid
him tribute.</p>

<p>He had a sister, named Kriemhild,
who was noted far and wide
for her wondrous beauty. Once
Kriemhild had had a strange
dream: She thought that she was
out hunting with her pet falcon,
and that two fierce eagles swooped
down from the sky, and killed the
bird before her eyes.</p>

<p>Now in these olden times people
were very superstitious, and believed
that every dream had a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
meaning. Kriemhild related her
dream to her mother, Uota, and
asked what it meant. Uota replied:</p>

<p>"The falcon signifies a noble
man who will win you for his
bride; but the two eagles stand for
two powerful enemies, who will
cause his death."</p>

<p>Then Kriemhild was very sad,
and declared that she did not wish
to marry any one, as it would
bring her only sorrow.</p>

<p>Not long after this Siegfried
arrived at Worms, and although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
he knew no one in all the city,
everybody was anxious to learn
who he was, he was so handsome
and noble looking. Hagen advised
Gunther to make friends
with him, for he thought it very
likely that the stranger might
prove to be Siegfried, whose fame
was spreading fast.</p>

<p>Hagen related how Siegfried
had killed the linden-monster,
slain the dragon, won the Rhine
gold, and gained possession of the
magic cap and ring. When Uota
heard all this, she determined that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Siegfried should marry her beautiful
daughter. When he entered
the castle at Worms, Gunther received
him cordially, and made
haste to offer him both food and
drink. Siegfried accepted both
gratefully, for he was hungry and
thirsty. Uota hastily prepared a
magic potion, and no sooner had
the hero drunk it than all memory
of the past, Brunhilda included,
faded from his mind.</p>

<span class="caption">UOTA GIVES SIEGFRIED THE MAGIC POTION</span>
</div>

<p>Siegfried remained at Worms for
one whole year, and in all that
time he never once got a glimpse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of Kriemhild, although the fame
of her beauty reached him from
every side. She, however, had
seen him from her window while
he was tilting with her brother's
knights, and she thought that
never before had she seen any one
so brave and handsome.</p>

<p>Not long after this, the Danes
and the Saxons declared war
against Gunther. He quickly
gathered together his army, and
set out to battle with them. His
two younger brothers, Giselherr
and Gernot, went with him, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Siegfried accompanied him as his
body-guard.</p>

<p>And now began anxious days
and nights for Kriemhild. She
was filled with dread lest her
brothers or Siegfried be slain.
She eagerly awaited tidings of
every battle. She heard that the
Saxons and Danes were being
hard pressed, and also that the
most brave and reckless warrior
among all the Burgundian hosts
was her brother's guest and body-guard.</p>

<p>Not long after this, the Burgundians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
were victorious, and captured
both the Danish and the
Saxon king. This ended the war,
and Gunther and all his troops
returned to Worms, where the
king held a great feast to celebrate
his victory. And here for
the first time Siegfried saw Kriemhild,
and he thought her the most
beautiful woman he had ever seen.</p>

<p>He was almost afraid to speak
to her, so wondrous was her
beauty, but she thanked him very
prettily and gratefully for all that
he had done for her brother; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
when he replied that everything
he had done had been done for
her sake, she smiled and was content.
Siegfried had fallen deeply
in love with her, and made up his
mind to spare no effort to win her
for his bride.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SIEGFRIED RETURNS TO IRELAND</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span>, in Ireland, Brunhilda
was eagerly awaiting Siegfried's
return. Days grew into
weeks, weeks lengthened into
months, and still he did not come.
At first she could not believe that
he had deserted her. She would
look at the beautiful ring which he
had given her, and all her faith
and trust in him would return.</p>

<p>But when months slowly lengthened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
into years, and the years
passed one after another, she began
to give up the hope of ever
seeing him again.</p>

<p>Now, as I have said before,
Brunhilda was very beautiful, and
soon suitors began flocking around
her, anxious to win her hand in
marriage. But Brunhilda loved
Siegfried very dearly and had no
desire to marry any one else.
Therefore she declared that whoever
sought to marry her must
match his strength with hers; if he
were victorious, she would wed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
him, but if he failed, he should
lose his head in forfeit, according
to the custom of these olden days.</p>

<p>Many gallant suitors came,
entered the contest, failed and
lost their heads, for Brunhilda was
a Walkyrie, and more than a
match in strength for any man.
She did not like to kill her lovers,
but they persisted in coming, and
she continued to do her best at
every trial.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the fame of her
strength and beauty traveled afar,
and reached Gunther at Worms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
He determined to journey to Isenheim,
and enter the lists against
her. Accordingly he went to Siegfried,
and asked aid of him. Siegfried
replied:</p>

<p>"I will gladly help you, if you, on
your part, will help me win the
hand of your beautiful sister."</p>

<p>Gunther was very grateful for
the aid Siegfried had given him in
the late Saxon war. So he promised
that on the day Brunhilda arrived
in Worms he would give him
Kriemhild for his bride. Siegfried
was satisfied, and agreed to travel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to Ireland with Gunther, as his
vassal, and to present his petition
to Brunhilda.</p>

<p>Then they arrayed themselves
in costly garments and set sail, and
after a twelve-day voyage, they
reached the coast of Ireland.
When Siegfried beheld the green
palaces of marble, he felt a vague
uneasiness, for it all had a
strangely familiar look. Where
had he seen this place before?
He remembered it dimly, as in a
dream.</p>

<p>When he entered Brunhilda's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
palace, she advanced to meet him,
with both hands outstretched,
crying:</p>

<p>"Siegfried, is it indeed you, and
have you come to tilt with me?"</p>

<p>He looked at her with the eyes
of a stranger, and replied:</p>

<p>"I come to represent Gunther,
King of Burgundy. He wishes to
sue for your heart and hand. He
is my lord; I am his vassal, and
have come to do his bidding."</p>

<p>Brunhilda was sorely grieved
and perplexed; she could not in
the least understand Siegfried's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
behavior. Surely it was he who
had aroused her from her magic
sleep, and surely it was he who
had placed the beautiful ring upon
her hand, vowing that he would
return and claim her for his bride.
But as he continued to look at her
as though he had never seen her
before, she felt that she must give
him a reply.</p>

<p>And as she had no reasonable
excuse for refusing his request, she
said that Gunther might enter the
lists with her. She felt sure that
he, too, would be overthrown.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Siegfried thanked her gravely for
her kindness, and made haste to
carry her reply back to Gunther.</p>

<p>He then disclosed his plan to aid
Gunther in the undertaking. Gunther
was to appear clad in armor
and mounted upon Siegfried's
horse, the one which had belonged
to Mimi; then he, Siegfried,
would put on his tarnhelm and become
invisible; Gunther was to
ride boldly into the field, and go
through all the necessary motions,
while Siegfried, unseen by the
others, would do all the actual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
fighting. Gunther said he considered
the plan a capital one, and
declared that Siegfried was as
clever as he was brave.</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HOW GUNTHER WON HIS BRIDE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> day of the tournament
dawned bright and fair. The field
was crowded with lovely women
and brave knights. Twelve men
now appeared, bearing an immense
round stone, which was so
large that it took all their united
strength to handle it. They set it
down in that part of the field
where the contest was to take
place.</p>

<p>At length all was ready. From<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the castle issued forth the warrior-king
and the warrior-maiden.
They were clad in glistening
armor, and mounted on prancing
chargers. The signal was given,
and then began a test of strength
such as had never before been
witnessed.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 310px;">
<img src="images/illus083.png" width="310" height="500" alt="BRUNHILDA WAS THROWN TO THE GROUND" title="" />
<span class="caption">BRUNHILDA WAS THROWN TO THE GROUND</span>
</div>

<p>Brunhilda seized her javelin,
and hurled it with such force that
when Siegfried caught it upon
Gunther's shield the shield was
shattered into pieces. Then Siegfried,
still invisible, grasped Gunther's
javelin, and hurled it with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
such force at Brunhilda that she
was thrown to the ground. She
was overcome with surprise and
anger; never before had such a
thing befallen her.</p>

<p>Quickly recovering herself, she
sprang to her feet, and grasping
the huge stone which twelve men
had found hard to carry, she
whirled it deftly thrice around her
head, and then threw it far into
the distance. Then, while the
people sat spell-bound, she leaped
after it, and sprang lightly over
the stone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now," thought she to herself,
"surely no one can do more than
that."</p>

<p>But she had reckoned without
Siegfried. Hastily seizing the
stone, he hurled it much farther
than Brunhilda had thrown it, and
not to be outdone by her, he
grasped Gunther firmly under the
arms, and sprang with him over
the stone, landing much farther
beyond it than she had.</p>

<p>Then a mighty shout from thousands
of throats rent the air, and
while the people were crowding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
around, hailing Gunther as victor,
Siegfried tore off his tarnhelm,
and took his place among the
crowd.</p>

<p>And now what could Brunhilda
do? She had publicly proclaimed
that she would marry any man
whose strength was greater than
her own, so sure had she felt of
her power. She would not break
her word, and so with a sorrowful
heart she made ready to travel
back to Worms with Gunther.</p>

<p>At Worms Kriemhild joyfully
accepted Siegfried's hand, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
there was a grand double wedding,
at which all Burgundy was
present. The festivities lasted
fourteen days.</p>

<p>One evening, while Gunther and
his bride were sitting together,
Gunther noticed tears on Brunhilda's
lashes, and asked what was
troubling her. She replied that
she was grieving that his sister
had married his vassal. This was
not the truth. She was feeling
sad and lonely because the man
she loved so well had taken
Kriemhild for his bride.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Gunther told her not to worry,
as he could explain all that to her,
and promised to do so at some
future time. He said that Siegfried
was greater than she knew.</p>

<p>After the wedding, Siegfried
and Kriemhild journeyed to Santum,
to visit Siegmund and Siegelinda,
whom he had left in his
youth. They were overjoyed to
see him, and listened with breathless
interest to all he had to
tell. They knew all about the
dragon, and the Rhine gold, and
the magic cap which he had won,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
for the fame of his wondrous
deeds had traveled far and wide.
And now, strange to tell, Siegfried
had recovered the memory of
almost all his past; only Brunhilda
and the magic ring remained forgotten.</p>

<p>After the young couple had
been at Santum for some time,
Siegmund withdrew from his
throne, and made Siegfried and
Kriemhild the rulers of the kingdom.
The people of Niederland
hailed the hero with delight,
although they grieved to give up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
their old king and queen, who had
won the hearts of all their subjects
by their wisdom and kindness.</p>

<h2>IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>KRIEMHILD AND BRUNHILDA'S QUARREL</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Years</span> passed by, and Brunhilda
had come to love her husband
very dearly. They had one child,
a little boy whom they had named
Siegfried. Kriemhild, meanwhile,
had been living very happily with
her husband in Niederland. They
had had two great sorrows, the
death of the old king and that of
the queen, and all the people of
Niederland still mourned the loss
of these two.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there arrived one day in
Niederland a messenger from the
King and Queen of Burgundy, inviting
Siegfried and Kriemhild to
attend a great feast which was to
be held in Worms. They accepted
with pleasure. Kriemhild was
anxious to see her mother and
brothers again, for she loved them
dearly. So they started for Burgundy.</p>

<p>For some days after they arrived
in Worms everything went
happily. But then the tournaments
began, and Siegfried won<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
every honor as he had done in days
gone by, for he had lost none of
his wonderful strength. Both the
queens were present at the contests,
and as he overthrew one
knight after another, Kriemhild
looked at him lovingly, and said
that he was the best and greatest
king the world had ever seen, and
that no king could stand against
him; all paid him tribute.</p>

<p>Brunhilda replied: "All except
Gunther; next to him Siegfried is
the most powerful king on earth;
but strong as your husband is, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
could never hold his own against
Gunther."</p>

<p>Kriemhild controlled her temper,
and made no reply, but that
evening when they attended vespers,
Kriemhild attempted to enter
the cathedral first. Brunhilda
interfered, saying:</p>

<p>"The wife of a vassal should
never precede the wife of his lord!"</p>

<p>"And who says that King Siegfried
is Gunther's vassal?" demanded
Kriemhild.</p>

<p>"I have his own word for it,"
Brunhilda replied. "When they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
first appeared in Ireland, Siegfried
approached me, saying: 'I come
to represent the King of Burgundy;
I am his vassal, he is my
lord.'"</p>

<p>Then Kriemhild lost all patience,
for well she knew by what
trick Gunther had won his bride.
She cried:</p>

<p>"And do you think that Gunther
overthrew you in the tilt? Gunther
only pretended to fight. It
was Siegfried, made invisible by
his tarnhelm, who did the real
fighting; it was Siegfried who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
hurled the javelin which unhorsed
you; it was Siegfried who threw
the heavy stone, and he it was,
invisible to you, but holding Gunther
in his arms, who sprang over
the stone, and vanquished you,"
she declared.</p>

<p>Looking at Kriemhild's heaving
breast and blazing eye, Brunhilda
knew she spoke the truth. And
at the same time, there flashed
across her mind something that
Gunther had once said to her
about Siegfried being greater than
she knew.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 316px;">
<img src="images/illus097.png" width="316" height="500" alt="&quot;IT WAS SIEGFRIED WHO DID THE REAL FIGHTING&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;IT WAS SIEGFRIED WHO DID THE REAL FIGHTING&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>And now she fell into a royal
rage, and her indignation knew no
bounds. There was but one way
of atonement; Siegfried must die
for the deceit practiced on her.
So she went to Hagen, Gunther's
uncle, who had promised always
to defend her rights, and demanded
Siegfried's life.</p>

<p>When Hagen first spoke to
Gunther of the matter, Gunther
would not hear of the plan to do
away with Siegfried, and vowed
that no harm should befall the
man with whom he had sworn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
blood brothership ere they set out
for Ireland. But Brunhilda was
firm in her resolve; nothing less
than his death would satisfy her
honor, nor wipe out the stain of
his deceit.</p>

<p>And finally Gunther gave an
unwilling consent. However, they
could not fall upon Siegfried,
and kill him in cold blood, so
Hagen made a clever plan: they
would receive a false summons
to war. Accordingly, a few days
later, a messenger rode posthaste
into Worms, bearing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
false tidings that the enemy was
approaching.</p>

<p>Then everything was in great
confusion, and Gunther assembled
his hosts, and set out to meet the
enemy. Siegfried accompanied
him, to render what assistance he
could, for he loved his kinsman as
a brother. Just before the army
started on the march, Kriemhild
went to Hagen, and begged him
to watch over her husband, and
see to it that no one attacked him
from behind, for she explained
that Siegfried could not be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
wounded anywhere except in the
spot on his back where the linden-leaf
had fallen.</p>

<p>Hagen readily promised. He
craftily suggested that Kriemhild
should sew some mark above the
spot, so that he might know exactly
when danger threatened.
Kriemhild fell in at once with his
plan; with loving care she stitched
a white silk cross upon her husband's
clothes. Then Gunther
and his troops rode away.</p>

<p>After they had ridden some
distance, they were met by another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
messenger, with the false
tidings that the enemy had begun
a retreat.</p>

<p>Gunther appeared to be overjoyed
at the news, and suggested
that a mighty hunt should be
held, to celebrate the occasion.
The troops were dispatched back
to Worms, and the royal party set
out for the chase, which they
greatly enjoyed.</p>

<p>When the dinner-horn sounded
for the hunters to assemble to
their meal, Siegfried appeared,
dragging a live bear behind him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
He was received with shouts of
applause. They at once proceeded
to kill and roast the bear.
Every one was in the best of
spirits, and as hungry as could be;
but when they sat down to eat, it
was discovered that the wine was
missing; Hagen had purposely left
it behind.</p>

<p>Siegfried, especially, was very
thirsty, and playfully chided Hagen
for forgetting so important an
article. Thereupon Hagen said
that he knew of a spring, not
far away, where Siegfried might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
quench his thirst, and dared him
to run a race there. Siegfried
accepted the challenge, and easily
won the race, as Hagen knew he
would.</p>

<p>He had laid aside his weapons,
and was already kneeling to drink,
when Hagen came up behind
him. "Ha, ha," laughed Siegfried,
"I have won the race, and
am therefore entitled to the first
drink."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 313px;">
<img src="images/illus105.png" width="313" height="500" alt="&quot;THE HERO HURLED IT WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AT HAGEN&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;THE HERO HURLED IT WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AT HAGEN&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"You are," answered Hagen
quietly, picking up Siegfried's
sword, and poising it above the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
spot where Kriemhild had sewn
the white cross; and without saying
another word, he drove it
home with such force that the
point of it pierced Siegfried's
breast.</p>

<p>In agony, the hero sprang to his
feet, and seizing his shield, hurled
it with all his might at Hagen,
throwing him to the ground.
Then he, too, fell, and the blood
from his wounds stained the grass
a deep crimson; and thus died
Siegfried, the great and mighty
hero, calling upon Kriemhild with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
his last breath to avenge his foul
murder.</p>

<p>Then they placed his body on
his shield and carried it back to
Worms, and laid it at Kriemhild's
door. Next morning, as she was
going to mass, her waiting-maid,
who preceded her on the way out,
suddenly gave a scream, and cried:</p>

<p>"Go back, go back, and do not
come this way, for here lies the
body of a dead warrior."</p>

<p>But Kriemhild's heart misgave
her, and she would not go back,
and when she saw the body she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
uttered a great cry, for she knew
instantly that it was Siegfried.</p>

<p>She bade the servants carry it
inside, and lay it on his bed, and
her grief knew no bounds. Then
she sent for Gunther, and wildly
accused him of the deed, and he
as wildly denied his guilt. Then
she said:</p>

<p>"If you are indeed innocent,
you need not fear to stand in the
presence of the dead."</p>

<p>Gunther was not afraid, and
went with her into the death
chamber. While they were standing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
there, looking at Siegfried,
Hagen suddenly entered the room,
and lo! all the dead man's wounds
began to bleed afresh.</p>

<p>She knew by this sign that Hagen
was guilty of her husband's
death, and she swore undying
vengeance. She supposed that he
had killed him to gain possession
of his vast riches, and she determined
to spoil his plan. But
Hagen was as crafty as he was
clever, and so he induced Brunhilda
to give him the gold ring as
a reward for his services to her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
She knew nothing of its great
value, and she hated it now because
it reminded her of the false
Siegfried. So she willingly gave
it to Hagen, whom she considered
her greatest benefactor.</p>

<p>No sooner had he the ring in his
possession than he journeyed to
Niederland, and there by its magic
power he gained possession of the
Rhine gold. It took him fourteen
days and nights to remove the
treasure from the cave on the
heath. He then sunk it in the
Rhine, where he intended to leave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
it hidden until after Kriemhild's
death; but no sooner had he
flung it into the river than the
Rhine nymphs seized it for their
own, determined to guard it so
well this time that never again
should their father, the God of
the Rhine, have occasion to bewail
its loss, and their unfaithfulness.</p>

<p>When Kriemhild reached Niederland,
and found that the gold
had been stolen from Fafner's
cave, she was even more determined
than before that she would
be revenged upon Hagen.</p>

<h2>X</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>KRIEMHILD'S REVENGE</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Years</span> passed by, and Kriemhild
still mourned the loss of her noble
husband. Often and often she
recalled the dream that she had
had in the days before Siegfried
appeared in Worms. How truly
her mother had interpreted its
meaning!</p>

<p>And now she had but one wish
on earth, and that was to avenge
his death. She was not so beautiful
as she had once been; constant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
tears had washed the brightness
from her eyes, and her cheeks
were pale.</p>

<p>One day there appeared in the
castle a noble-looking stranger,
who asked to speak with the
queen. He was admitted to her
presence, and she asked him his
name, and also to what she owed
the honor of his presence at her
court.</p>

<p>He replied: "I am Rudiger of
Bechlarn, of the court of Etzelburg.
I have come hither at the
request of my master, Etzel the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
King of the Huns, to ask your
hand for him in marriage."</p>

<p>At first Kriemhild refused to
listen to him. What had she to
do with love and marriage? All
the love of her heart lay buried
in Siegfried's grave; all the joy of
her life had vanished when he
died. All that she wished for was
revenge, and after that to share
her dear one's tomb.</p>

<p>But Rudiger would not take no
for an answer. Then, when he
found that revenge was what she
longed for, he saw his opportunity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
He told her that if she would but
become King Etzel's wife, he, himself,
would promise to avenge her
every wrong, not only those which
might arise in time to come, but
even those which she had suffered
in the past.</p>

<p>Here at last was the chance she
had so patiently awaited, and she
eagerly seized it. She consented
to become Etzel's bride, and
Rudiger willingly swore undying
fealty to her and her cause. And
so she returned with him to Etzelburg,
where the marriage was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
celebrated with royal pomp and
ceremony.</p>

<p>King Etzel loved Kriemhild
dearly, and was very kind to her.
She was truly grateful to him, but
she could not forget Siegfried, not
even when a dear little son came
to her. The child was named Ortlieb.
And so time sped by, until
the little boy's fifth birthday.</p>

<p>Kriemhild had now been in
Etzelburg thirteen years, and in
all this time she had neither seen
nor heard from her home and
kindred. One day she went to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
her husband, and told him that
she was becoming ashamed of
being a stranger in a foreign land
without any kinspeople of her
own. She said she thought it was
high time that some of her family
should come to visit her, and
begged him to make a feast, and
invite them all to be present.</p>

<p>Her slightest wish was Etzel's
law, and so he willingly granted
her request. He at once dispatched
a messenger with the invitation.
Just before the messenger
set out, Kriemhild went to him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and told him to be sure that every
one of her relatives accepted the
invitation. In this way, she hoped
to get her uncle Hagen within
reach, without rousing any one's
suspicions.</p>

<p>Now, when it had become known
in Worms that Etzel had asked
Kriemhild to marry him, Hagen
had been filled with alarm. He
told Gunther that it might mean
great disaster for them, should
Kriemhild marry Etzel, as he was
one of the most powerful kings of
the time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>But now thirteen years had
passed, and they had neither seen
nor heard from the Hunnish king
and queen, and Gunther no longer
feared trouble from that source.
Then came Kriemhild's invitation,
and for seven days it was discussed
by the royal family at
Worms.</p>

<p>Should they accept it? Gunther
and his two brothers, Giselherr
and Gernot, were anxious to do
so, for they thought it meant that
their sister wished to be at peace
with her family. Gunther, particularly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
was eager to be friendly,
as he loved Kriemhild dearly.</p>

<p>Hagen alone had misgivings,
and well might he dread meeting
her, for he knew how sorely she
had suffered at his hands. He
sullenly refused to go, until Gernot
at length cried out:</p>

<p>"I know what ails Hagen! He
is thinking of Siegfried's death,
and fears to go to Etzelburg."</p>

<p>Hagen did not wish to be
thought afraid, so he consented to
go, and they all prepared to accompany
the messenger to Etzel's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
court on the following day&mdash;all
except Uota, who was getting too
old and feeble to leave home.</p>

<p>That night Uota had a dreadful
dream; she thought that all the
birds lay dead in the forests, and
when she awoke, she hated to see
her sons go, for she knew that her
dream meant danger to them.</p>

<p>However, they set out, accompanied
by one thousand brave
men. On their way to Etzel's
country, they came to a river that
they had to cross; but they found
they could not cross it on horseback,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
as it was swollen too high.
So they had to wait until a boat
should appear.</p>

<p>While they were waiting, they
chanced to see two swan-maidens,
who had come to the stream to
bathe; the maidens had laid aside
their feathers, and were playing
about in the water like mermaids.
Now Hagen knew they possessed
the gift of foretelling the future,
and he laid a clever plan.</p>

<p>When they came out of the
water, they found their clothes
gone, and they were very much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
troubled, for without their feather
garments they could not fly away.
Then Hagen approached them,
and said he would give their
feathers back if they would tell
him what was to happen to the
Burgundians in Etzel's land.
Then one of the maidens, who
cared nothing for him or his
friends, and thought only of regaining
her clothes, without which
she could never reach her home in
the sky, replied:</p>

<p>"Everything is fair and clear
for the men of Burgundy. Sail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
on, sail on. You have naught to
fear."</p>

<p>Hagen was delighted, and returned
their garments with a light
heart. The maidens quickly put
their feathers on, and spread their
wings in flight; but as they rose
into the blue sky the second one
cried to Hagen:</p>

<p>"Turn back, turn back; death
and bloodshed await you in Etzelburg!
Only one, of all your number,
will ever live to see your native
land again."</p>

<p>Then they disappeared in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
azure depths above, and Hagen
was left with a heavy heart.</p>

<p>At length the Burgundians
secured a vessel, and embarked.
They were met on the other side
of the river by Dietrich von Bern,
one of the lords of the Hunnish
court, who greeted Hagen with
these words of friendly warning:</p>

<p>"Kriemhild still mourns for
Siegfried's loss."</p>

<p>But poor Hagen had no way of
turning back; he had to accompany
the others, whether he would
or no. And sure enough, when he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
came into Kriemhild's presence
she drew herself up haughtily, and
asked:</p>

<p>"And pray, who invited you
here, Sir Hagen? Who bid you
to this feast?"</p>

<p>Hagen replied that he was a retainer
of Gunther's, and that wherever
Gunther went, he, too, must
go; but her attitude and greeting
showed him plainly that she
had not forgiven him for his
treachery.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 309px;">
<img src="images/illus127.png" width="309" height="500" alt="&quot;AND, PRAY, WHO INVITED YOU HERE, SIR HAGEN?&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;AND, PRAY, WHO INVITED YOU HERE, SIR HAGEN?&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Kriemhild greeted her brothers
very cordially, and seemed rejoiced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
to see them, and for a few
days all went well. Then came
the banquet, in the midst of which
in rushed Dankwart, Hagen's
brother, with blood flowing from a
dozen wounds, and told them that
the Huns had fallen upon Gunther's
men and slain them all.</p>

<p>And immediately everything was
in the wildest confusion. Protected
by Rudiger, Kriemhild and
Etzel escaped from the banquet
hall. Then ensued a fierce battle
in which all of the Huns, with the
exception of Dietrich, and all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Burgundians, except Gunther and
Hagen, were slain. Finally Dietrich
vanquished these two, and
bound them hand and foot. Then
he sought Kriemhild, and made
her give her word of honor that
he, and he alone, should be permitted
to put them to death.
After that he turned the prisoners
over into her keeping. She
ordered them to be confined in
separate dungeons.</p>

<p>Then she visited Hagen and
sought by every means in her
power to discover what he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
done with the Rhine gold. This
he refused to tell, saying he had
taken a solemn oath never to reveal
its hiding-place so long as
one of his lords remained alive.
Then she said that she would
spare Gunther's life if Hagen
would tell her where the gold was
secreted.</p>

<p>But Hagen would not tell his
secret, even to save the life of his
liege lord and kinsman. And so
she ordered that both of them
should be beheaded, according to
the custom of these olden times.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
And thus at last was Siegfried's
death avenged by the once gentle
and beautiful queen.</p>

<p>And of all the men of Burgundy
who had crossed the water to attend
King Etzel's feast, but one
remained to carry the sad news
back to their native land; and that
was the old chaplain of Gunther's
court. Everything had come to
pass just as the swan-maiden had
predicted. And back in Burgundy,
Uota sorrowfully lived out
her days with none in all that
broad land to brew for her lips the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
cup of forgetfulness, such as she
had given Siegfried. And so we
must leave her alone with her sad
memories.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
